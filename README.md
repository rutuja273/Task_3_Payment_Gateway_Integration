# Task_3_Payment_Gateway_Integration
Objectives of the project:

-> Create a simple website where a payment gateway is integrated.

-> On the homepage, a simple "donate" button should be provided.On clicking the "donate" button, the user is then redirected to a payment page where they can enter the amount to be paid and select the payment type.

-> Once the payment is done, an invoice will be generated, and an email will be sent to the user for the payment received. The invoice will contain the amount.
